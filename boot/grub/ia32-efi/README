The binary files of GRUB boot loader in this directory have been created
by compiling GRUB for the 'i386-efi' and 'x86_64-efi' targets. The combined
32bit and 64bit EFI boot floppy image was created by modifying the
i386-grub-mkrescue and x86_64-grub-mkrescue scripts to create EFI payloads
which search for the bootable ISO image with the volume label
'HelenOS boot ISO'.

For licensing terms of GRUB boot loader see the file COPYING contained
in this directory. Full version of GRUB, including its source code,
can be downloaded from GRUB's project page:
