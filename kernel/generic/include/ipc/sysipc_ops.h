/**
 * This header declares the per-method IPC callbacks. Using these callbacks,
 * each IPC method (but system methods in particular), can define actions that
 * will be called at specific moments in the call life-cycle.
 *
 * Normally, the kernel will attempt to invoke the following callbacks in the
 * following order on each call:
 *
 * request_preprocess()
 * request_process()
 * answer_preprocess()
 * answer_process()
 *
 * This callback invocation sequence is a natural order of processing. Note,
 * however, that due to various special circumstances, callbacks may be called
 * also in a different than natural order of processing. This means that some
 * callbacks may be skipped and some others may be called instead.
 *
 * The additional callbacks that may be called are as follows:
 *
 * request_forget()
 * answer_cleanup()
 *
 * There are several notable scenarios in which some callbacks of the natural
 * order of processing will be skipped.
 *
 * The request_process(), answer_preprocess() and answer_process() callbacks
 * will be skipped if the call cannot be delivered to the callee. This may
 * happen when e.g. the request_preprocess() callback fails or the connection
 * to the callee is not functional. The next callback that will be invoked on
 * the call is request_forget().
 *
 * The comments for each callback type describe the specifics of each callback
 * such as the context in which it is invoked and various constraints.
