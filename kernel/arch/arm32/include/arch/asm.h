/** CPU specific way to sleep cpu.
 *
 * ARMv7 introduced wait for event and wait for interrupt (wfe/wfi).
 * ARM920T has custom coprocessor action to do the same. See ARM920T Technical
 * Reference Manual ch 4.9 p. 4-23 (103 in the PDF)
 * ARM926EJ-S uses the same coprocessor instruction as ARM920T. See ARM926EJ-S
 * chapter 2.3.8 p.2-22 (52 in the PDF)
 *
 * @note Although CP15WFI (mcr p15, 0, R0, c7, c0, 4) is defined in ARM
 * Architecture reference manual for armv4/5, CP15 implementation is mandatory
 * only for armv6+.
