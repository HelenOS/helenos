/**
 * Finds out which execution units belong to particular CPUs. By execution unit
 * we mean the physical core the logical processor is backed by. Since each
 * Niagara physical core has just one integer execution unit and we will
 * ignore other execution units than the integer ones, we will use the terms
 * "integer execution unit", "execution unit" and "physical core"
 * interchangeably.
 *
 * The physical cores are detected by browsing the children of the CPU node
 * in the machine description and looking for a node representing an integer
 * execution unit. Once the integer execution unit of a particular CPU is
 * known, the ID of the CPU is added to the list of cpuids of the corresponding
 * execution unit structure (exec_unit_t). If an execution unit is encountered
 * for the first time, a new execution unit structure (exec_unit_t) must be
 * created first and added to the execution units array (exec_units).
 *
 * If the function fails to find an execution unit for a CPU (this may happen
 * on machines with older firmware or on Simics), it performs a fallback code
 * which pretends there exists just one execution unit and all CPUs belong to
 * it.
 *
 * Finally, the array of all execution units is reordered such that its element
 * which represents the physical core of the the bootstrap CPU is at index 0.
 * Moreover, the array of CPU IDs within the BSP's physical core structure is
 * reordered such that the element which represents the ID of the BSP is at
 * index 0. This is done because we would like the CPUs to be woken up
 * such that the 0-index CPU of the 0-index execution unit is
 * woken up first. And since the BSP is already woken up, we would like it to be
 * at 0-th position of the 0-th execution unit structure.
 *
 * Apart from that, the code also counts the total number of CPUs and stores
 * it to the global config.cpu_count variable.
