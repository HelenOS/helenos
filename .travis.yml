# Travis CI configuration notes
# -----------------------------
#
# * HelenOS is always built for all architectures
#   * that is done using matrix environmental variables
#   * the list of architectures has to be kept manually in sync with
#     HelenOS.config
#   * the actual architecture is specified via H_ARCH variable
#
# * ported software is built when H_HARBOURS is set to true for given
#   configuration
#   * building ported software takes a lot of time, it is thus impossible
#     to build for all architectures
#   * some ports are known to fail for certain architectures: because that
#     would make the whole build failing, we currently build only for ia32
#     that seems to be in the best condition with respect to ported software
#   * list of harbours is also maintained manually, look for a variable
#     H_DEFAULT_HARBOURS_LIST to allow overriding from within this file
#
# * since the setup is rather complicated we use a dedicated shell script to
#   run the actual build process and installation of the cross-compiler
#   toolchain
#
# * if you have enabled Travis in your feature branch you may want to change
#   some of the settings to better suite your needs
#   * reduce number of built architectures (probably not needed)
#   * built ported software for a different architecture
#     * specify H_HARBOURS=true
#     * optionally specify H_HARBOUR_LIST="..." to a list of harbours to be
#       built
#     * optionally specify H_HARBOURS_REPOSITORY="..." to point to your repo
#       with HARBOUR files
