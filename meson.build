## The at-sign
#
# The `atsign` variable holds the ASCII character representing the at-sign
# ('@') used in various $(AS) constructs (e.g. @progbits). On architectures that
# don't use '@' for starting a comment, `atsign` is merely '@'. However, on
# those that do use it for starting a comment (e.g. arm32), `atsign` must be
# defined as the percentile-sign ('%') in the architecture-dependent files.
