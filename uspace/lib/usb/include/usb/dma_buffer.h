/** @file
 * @brief USB host controller library: DMA buffer helpers
 *
 * Simplifies handling of buffers accessible to hardware. Defines properties of
 * such buffer, which can be communicated through IPC to allow higher layers to
 * allocate a buffer that is ready to be passed to HW right away (after being
 * shared through IPC).
 *
 * Currently, it is possible to allocate either completely contiguous buffers
 * (with dma_map_anonymous) or arbitrary memory (with as_area_create). Shall the
 * kernel be updated, this is a subject of major optimization of memory usage.
 * The other way to do it without the kernel is building an userspace IO vector
 * in a similar way how QEMU does it.
 *
 * The structures themselves are defined in usbhc_iface, because they need to be
 * passed through IPC.

/**
 * The DMA policy describes properties of the buffer. It is used in two
 * different contexts. Either it represents requirements, which shall be
 * satisfied to avoid copying the buffer to a more strict one. Or, it is the
 * actual property of the buffer, which can be more strict than requested. It
 * always holds that more bits set means more restrictive policy, and that by
 * computing a bitwise OR one gets the restriction that holds for both.
 *
 * The high bits of a DMA policy represent a physical contiguity. If bit i is
 * set, it means that chunks of a size 2^(i+1) are contiguous in memory. It
 * shall never happen that bit i > j is set when j is not.
 *
 * The previous applies for i >= PAGE_WIDTH. Lower bits are used as bit flags.
