/**
 * Host controller side endpoint structure.
 *
 * This structure, though reference-counted, is very fragile. It is responsible
 * for synchronizing transfer batch scheduling and completion.
 *
 * To avoid situations, in which two locks must be obtained to schedule/finish
 * a transfer, the endpoint inherits a lock from the outside. Because the
 * concrete instance of mutex can be unknown at the time of initialization,
 * the HC shall pass the right lock at the time of onlining the endpoint.
 *
 * The fields used for scheduling (online, active_batch) are to be used only
 * under that guard and by functions designed for this purpose. The driver can
 * also completely avoid using this mechanism, in which case it is on its own in
 * question of transfer aborting.
 *
 * Relevant information can be found in the documentation of HelenOS xHCI
 * project.
