/**
 * NOTE: Following description is just a result of brainstorming on how the
 *       driver of real physical graphic accelerator could be supported by
 *       libgraph.
 *
 * Renderer represents the hardware graphic accelerator. If the device driver
 * handles more than one physical accelerator (e.g. graphic cards connected in
 * SLI mode or single graphic card with two GPUs), it is up to the driver
 * whether the load balancing will be exposed to the clients (that is the
 * driver will provide multiple renderers) or not (just a single renderer
 * handling the load balancing internally).
 *
 * At runtime, renderer is represented by scheduling thread and multiple
 * connection fibrils handling client requests. For each client, there is
 * command queue, condition variable and device context. Connection fibril puts
 * the command into the command queue and blocks on the condition variable.
 * Scheduling thread decides what client to serve, switches corresponding device
 * context into the accelerator, consumes the command from the command queue and
 * executes it on the accelerator. When the command execution is finished, the
 * condition variable si signalled and the connection fibril answers the client.
 *
 * Operations that are not implemented in the hardware of the accelerator might
 * be carried out by worker threads managed by scheduling thread. If the
 * accelerator physical memory is mapped to the address space of the driver, it
 * could be extended by allowing scheduling thread to page out the memory and
 * to handle the page faults.
 *
 * NOTE: It is not entirely clear which parts should be implemented in libgraph
 *       and which in the device driver. As a rough sketch, the connection
 *       fibril routine, command queue and memory paging should be handled
 *       by libgraph. The scheduling thread and device context should be
 *       provided by device driver.
