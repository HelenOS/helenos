 * "Restricted" fibril mutex.
 *
 * Similar to `fibril_mutex_t`, but has a set of restrictions placed on its
 * use. Within a rmutex critical section, you
 *         - may not use any other synchronization primitive,
 *           save for another `fibril_rmutex_t`. This includes nonblocking
 *           operations like cvar signal and mutex unlock, unless otherwise
 *           specified.
 *         - may not read IPC messages
 *         - may not start a new thread/fibril
 *           (creating fibril without starting is fine)
 *
 * Additionally, locking with a timeout is not possible on this mutex,
 * and there is no associated condition variable type.
 * This is a design constraint, not a lack of implementation effort.

	//       while a fibril has a rmutex locked. That means that for
	//       single-threaded programs, we can reduce all rmutex locks and
	//       unlocks to simple branches on a global bool variable.
