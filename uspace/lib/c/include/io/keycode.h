/** Keycode definitions.
 *
 * A keycode identifies a key by its position on the keyboard, rather
 * than by its label. For human readability, key positions are noted
 * with the key label on a keyboard with US layout. This label has
 * nothing to do with the character, that the key produces
 * -- this is determined by the keymap.
 *
 * The keyboard model reflects a standard PC keyboard layout.
 * Non-standard keyboards need to be mapped to this model in some
 * logical way. Scancodes are mapped to keycodes with a scanmap.
 *
 * For easier mapping to the model and to emphasize the nature of keycodes,
 * they really are organized here by position, rather than by label.
