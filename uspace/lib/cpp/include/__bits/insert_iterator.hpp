     * Note: Commonly the data structures in this library
     *       contain a set of insert member functions. These
     *       are often both iterator based and copy based.
     *       This iterator can change the copy version into
     *       an iterator version by creating a count based copy
     *       iterator.
     * Usage:
     *      first == insert_iterator{value}
     *      last  == insert_iterator{count}
     *
     *      So the following code:
     *          while (first != last)
     *              *data_++ = *first++;
     *
     *      Will insert a copy of value into the data_
     *      iterator exactly count times.
     * TODO: Apply this to existing containers?
