## Tools

This directory contains various scripts.
Some of them are used by the build system itself and are not relevant for most
people. Others are available for manual use, and that category further
divides into those meant to be used in the source directory, and those that
work on the build directory.


### Source directory scripts

 * build_all.sh
   - Builds (or incrementally rebuilds) all predefined HelenOS configurations.
     Can be executed in arbitrary directory outside the source tree.
 * build-ccheck.sh
   - Builds the ccheck tool.
 * ccheck.sh
   - Runs the ccheck tool to verify coding style of C files in the repository.
 * srepl
   - A refactoring tool for global search-and-replace operations. Sed wrapper.
 * toolchain.sh
   - Builds the cross-compiler toolchains necessary to build HelenOS.
 * release.sh
   - Builds everything (as in build_all.sh), and generates release artifacts.


### Build directory scripts

 * ew.py
   - Emulator Wrapper. After building the system image, some machines can be
     run in an emulator, mostly QEMU. This script simplifies it.
 * export.sh
   - Exports a subset of development files in a form suitable for cross-compiling
     third-party software independently of the HelenOS source tree.
     The exported files are specific for the currently built configuration.


### Used by build scripts

 * autocheck.awk
 * cc.sh
 * config.py
 * mkarray.py, mkarray_for_meson.sh
 * mkuimage.py


### Misc

 * filldir.py
   - Fill a directory with N empty directories. Seems to be unused, purpose unclear.
 * gentestfile.py
   - Generates test file for uspace/app/testread.
 * jobfile.py
   - Obsolete tooling support. Replaced by Meson.
 * mkext2.py, mkext4.py, mkfat.py
   - File system builders that don't require root privileges.
     Used by build scripts and by ew.py.
 * travis.sh
   - Runs Travis CI jobs. Not meant for human consumption.
 * imgutil.py, xstruct.py, xtui.py
   - Libraries for other python scripts.
