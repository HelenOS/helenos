# Example cross-build for HelenOS using XCW (HelenOS Cross Compiler Wrapper)
# This allows an external (cross-platform) application to be compiled for
# HelenOS by changing the compiler/linker helenos-cc/helenos-ld and adding
# platform-specific support. To configure use of HelenOS libraries one can use
# helenos-pkg-config. The HelenOS source tree containing XCW must be configured
# and build for XCW to work as a cross compiler.
#
# Example commands to build this demo:
#
#    cd <helenos-source-dir>
#    mkdir build
#    cd build
#    ../configure.sh
#    ninja
#    ../tools/export.sh export
#    cd ../tools/xcw/demo
#    export PATH=$PATH:<helenos-source-dir>/build/tools/xcw/bin
#    make
